  ;; Church encoding of functions, such as '位', does not 
  ;; naturally support 'recur'. This is because the '位' macro expands into an 
  ;; anonymous function (created using 'fn'), and functions defined with 'fn' 
  ;; cannot use 'recur' unless the 'recur' is in the tail position.
  ;;
  ;; The 'fn' function in Clojure is needed because it allows us to define a 
  ;; recursive function where 'recur' can be used correctly in the tail position. 
  ;; When the function is structured with 'fn', 'recur' will correctly jump back 
  ;; to the function without adding a new stack frame, thus ensuring the recursion 
  ;; is efficient and won't result in stack overflow.

      ;; Church's 'If' introduces an additional function call, which prevents 'recur'
      ;; from being the final operation, thus breaking TCO and causing a stack overflow.
      ;; Hence, using native 'if' instead of Church's 'If' because
      ;; 'recur' must be the last operation for tail call optimization (TCO).
